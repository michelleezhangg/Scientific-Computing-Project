# Scientific-Computing-Project

## Project Description
#### Project Background Information
This project explored the affects of minimizing a physical system's potential energy through experimentation and code manipulation. The entire project consists of manipulating code in order to discover more about the affects that altering certain values and variables have on the entire physical system. Additionally, some research was conducted to explore some real-world applications of our project and what it may uncover, specifically in the fields of Chemistry, Materials Science, and Civil/Structural Engineering.

#### Project Collaboration Details
This project was completed over the course of 2-3 months in the Fall of 2021 in a course at Chapman University, PHYS 220 (Scientific Computing) which is a course focused on teaching students about the fundamentals of computational physics and the bridge between physics and computational technologies and skills.

Four colleagues and I developed the code and worked extensively on this project over the course of a few months. Although we all collaborated on the project together, all of the code we each wrote was entirely our own.

Each of our findings were presented in a 60-minute presentation-discussion involving showcasing the code and our discoveries with the class along with explaining the entirity of the project in detail, the experimentation that we had with it, and we answered the questions raised by our peers and our professor.

## Technologies

Here are a few technologies my group and I utilized for this project:
* The entire project was coded in Python.
* We utilized a few notable Python libraries: NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.
* This project was completed in Jupyter Notebook.
* We also utilized Markdown to explain our code and display mathematical equations.
